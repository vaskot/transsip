What libraries are required?
============================

To run transsip, you need:
 * libcelt
 * libspeexdsp
 * libasound

On Debian simply type:
# apt-get install libcelt0-0 libcelt-dev        \
                  libspeexdsp1 libspeexdsp-dev  \
                  libasound2-dev libasound2

If the compiler somehow complains about not finding libspeexdsp1, try:
# ln -s /usr/lib/libspeexdsp.so.1 /usr/lib/libspeexdsp.so

Furthermore, note that a network connection speed not less than 128 kbps
(equals DSL 1000 in some countries) in both directions is needed in order
to place calls.

Installation
============

$ make
# make install

Uninstall
