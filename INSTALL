What libraries are required? To run transsip, you need:

 - cmake (all)
 - libpthread (transsip)
 - libcelt (transsip)
 - libspeexdsp (transsip)
 - libasound (transsip)
 - libreadline (transsip)

It is common, that these libraries are shipped as distribution packages
for an easy installation. We try to keep this as minimal as possible.

Furthermore, note that a network connection speed not less than 128 kbps
(equals DSL 1000 in some countries) in both directions is needed in order
to place calls.

The installation process done by cmake is fairly simple:

  $ cd transsip/src/
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  # make install

Man pages are generated out of the corresponding source files by cmake.
They are written in POD format as a C header comment within those files.
For this, you need the tool pod2man which is distributed with Perl and
should therefore be available on most systems.

To uninstall, simply remove all files refered in install_manifest.txt
