 transsip is a toolkit for creating a peer-to-peer overlay network for
 strongly encrypted, privacy-preserving voice-over-IP telecommunication.

The transsip telephony network uses a high-speed ECDH mechanism (Curve25519)
to protect voice data on end-to-end. Moreover, it uses the low-latency CELT
codec on top of ALSA for encoding and decoding the audio channel. Participants
can perform a direct IP-to-IP call or do a lookup of their communication
partner through the transsip Kademlia distributed hash table. The aim of
transsip is to provide a free, open source solution for privacy-preserving
voice-over-IP telecommunication that is independant of a third party.

Why transsip [1]? There are a few available voice-over-IP solutions out there
such as Skype. However, most of the are proprietary, so that we are not able
to know if there are hidden backdoors included, or use a weak encryption or no
encryption at all. Also, some of the existing solutions route voice traffic
through their private servers and use these data for other purposes. Therefore
our software closes this gap of an open source solution to preserve users privacy.

The transsip toolkit is an open source project covered by the GNU General
Public License. For any questions or feedback about transsip you are welcome
to leave us a message to <workgroup@transsip.org> or to our mailing list
at <transsip@googlegroups.com> (Note: you have to register first). This
project is purely non-commercial and will always stay that way!

Also, have a look at our FAQ [2] for answering your questions. Furthermore,
we have a development blog [3] where we sometimes drop some interesting things
or news for the outside world! A public repository of the old stable releases
(which you probably do not want to have a look at), can be found here [4].

You might want to have a look at INSTALL, REPORTING-BUGS, HACKING, CODING,
and COPYING, too. We would be happy for patches, reviews and more. Anyways,
enough talking from my side and happy talking via transsip!
