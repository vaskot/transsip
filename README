The aim of transsip is to provide free, open source utilities for decentralized,
privacy-preserving voice-over-IP communication, that is independant of untrusted
and centralized third parties. Also, by the use of strong encryption, it puts
and end to unauthorized listeners.

Why transsip [1]? There are a few available voice-over-IP solutions out there
such as Skype [2]. However, most of them are proprietary, so that we are not
able to know if there are hidden backdoors / LI interfaces included, or use
a weak encryption or no encryption at all. And as you see from Skype's analysis,
there cannot come anything good from that software. We do not only want to blame
Skype, but there's lots of such crap out there that cannot be trusted. Also,
some of the existing solutions route voice traffic through their private servers
and use these data for other purposes. Therefore our software closes this gap of
an open source solution to preserve users privacy.

The transsip toolkit is an open source project covered by the GNU General

Furthermore, we have a development blog [4] where we sometimes drop some
interesting things or news for the outside world! A public repository of the old
stable releases can be found here [5].
