The aim of transsip is to provide free, open source utilities for
privacy-preserving voice-over-IP telecommunication that is independant of
untrusted and centralized third parties. Also, by the use of strong encryption,
it puts and end to unauthorized listeners.

Why transsip [1]? There are a few available voice-over-IP solutions out there
such as Skype [2]. However, most of them are proprietary, so that we are not
able to know if there are hidden backdoors included, or use a weak encryption
or no encryption at all. And as you see from Skype's analysis, there cannot
come anything good from that software. We do not only want to blame Skype,
but there's lots of such crap out there that cannot be trusted. Also, some of
the existing solutions route voice traffic through their private servers and
use these data for other purposes. Therefore our software closes this gap of
an open source solution to preserve users privacy.

The transsip toolkit is an open source project covered by the GNU General
Public License. For any questions or feedback about transsip you are welcome
to leave us a message to <workgroup@transsip.org> or to our mailing list
at <transsip@googlegroups.com> (Note: you have to register first). This
project is purely non-commercial and will always stay that way!

Warning: this software is an experimental prototype intended for researchers.

Also, have a look at our FAQ [3] for answering your questions. Furthermore,
we have a development blog [4] where we sometimes drop some interesting things
or news for the outside world! A public repository of the old stable releases
can be found here [5].
